In particular, we will explore the [**Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). This challenge brought to light bias in the data that sparked the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification). \n",
